# Kushim
## Open Source Minimalist Life Management Tool

### About
I have started building this for myself. I have started with a Journaling app that was inspired by Derek @Sivers [post on Journaling](https://sivers.org/dj). I have kept a physical journal for the past 6 months and wanted to experiment with a digital version, but couldn't find anything that fit my needs. I have now fully moved my journal to [Kushim](https://kushim.io). This is how my current setup looks like:
